## Step-by-Step Process

- User Accesses the Website:

    1. The browser asks for permission to access the user's camera and microphone.
    2. Once permission is granted, the video and audio feed starts.

- WebRTC Captures Media:

    3. The browser uses WebRTC to capture the user's camera and microphone feed.
    4. WebRTC prepares the media stream for real-time transmission.

- Connection Setup (Signaling):

    5. The browser communicates with the Node.js server using Socket.IO.
    6. This process, called signaling, helps WebRTC and the server understand how to send/receive the media stream.

- Stream Sent to Node.js Server:

    7. The WebRTC stream is sent to the Node.js server over a low-latency connection.
    8. The server ensures the stream is received and prepared for  further processing.

- Media Processing with FFmpeg:

    9. The Node.js server forwards the WebRTC stream to FFmpeg.
    FFmpeg processes the stream (e.g., changes the format, compresses it, or encodes it).

- Send Stream to RTMP Server:

    10. After processing, FFmpeg sends the stream to an RTMP server (a special server for live video streaming).
    11. The RTMP server gets the stream ready for live broadcasting.

- Broadcast to Platforms:

    12. The RTMP server sends the live stream to platforms like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, or any other supported service.
